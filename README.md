# My weird, kinky, and not well-organized config files

![thelookofit](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51455723/170556296-3d1d0a80-94d7-4b6b-b7e1-a505c0bbe10f.png)

### Contains config files for:
- Zsh
- Tmux
- Micro
- Neofetch

### Dependendies
Everything listed above except neofetch, i tried to integrate every software listed above one into another, like for example, tmux starts zsh, in zsh i have prompt built from only 1 symbol, the path that you see at the top of the zsh prompt is in fact handled by tmux itself.

### Recommendations 
It is better to use with any vte-based terminal emulator (gnome-terminal with ubuntu-mono fonts in my case), triangle symbols that i use for tabs look broken in other terminals, you can still change those symbols to your font-specific ones, so it may work as well in any other terminal, the reason why it's not done this way already is the fact that it requires nerd-fonts
